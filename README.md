## This is a log of the learning process 

1. I didn't add a ceiling at first and the jump did not diasble. So naturally the AI learned to perma jump.

2. After adding the ceiling the AI learns to not ram on it.

3. After fixing the obnoxious jump function and the rest of the shit, the AI finally learns to properly play this game. It still perma ducks tho.
